# Installation
1. Change .htaccess accordingly (in most cases changing the rewriteBase is enough)
2. Run installation by visiting your installation in a browser.
3. Set default project: define default_controller in default.php (initially "install").

# What is neoanPHP?

With more and more technologies moving into the direction of cli-based development, a lack of understanding of what
happens "under the hood" is a common problem for young developers.

neoanPHP comes with concr, a GUI-based building-tool with the convenience of a cli helper, while concr itself
is a regular component of neoanPHP and delivers customizable and understandable procedures in order to
help developers start projects rapidly while providing a framework that enables them to grow into the profession.
